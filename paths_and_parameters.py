### Parameters of synthetic phases ###
min_theta = 17
max_theta = 42
min_intensity = 0.1  # among the tabulated peaks, selects only the ones above this threshold of intensity (scale between 0 and 1)
first_n_peaks = 5    # selects the first n most intense peaks (if None, leaves all the peaks)
sigma = 0.15         # sigma used in the peaks of synthetic diffraction patterns

### Experimental setting ###
angle_incidence = 10.5 # angle between the incident beam and the plane of the painting
channel_distance = 50 # distance in microns between two adjacent channels of the detector

### Reading XRF ###
xrf_axes_flip = [1] # which axes to flip when reading XRF data (0: vertical, 1: horizontal)
